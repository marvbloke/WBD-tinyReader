# World Book Day - tinyReader
 eBook reader for small OLED displays with RP2040

This is a simple microPython script which reads a plain text file and displays it on a small OLED I2C display. Works on Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040-based boards. It is being used for a small coin cell powered badge to be worn for World Book Day (4th March 2021).
